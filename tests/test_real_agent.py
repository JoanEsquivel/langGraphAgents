Real Agent Evaluation Tests

These tests execute the actual 3_basic_chat_bot_with_tools_memory.py agent
and evaluate real responses using RAGAS metrics for comprehensive assessment.

Test Coverage:
- Basic agent functionality and tool usage (weather information)
- Topic adherence evaluation (weather + automation testing topics)
- Tool call accuracy assessment (automation testing framework research)
- Goal completion accuracy with reference standards (test automation research)
